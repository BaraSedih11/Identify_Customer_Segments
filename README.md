This project applies **unsupervised learning** techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors. By clustering customers into meaningful groups, businesses can target their strategies more effectively and optimize resource allocation.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to identify distinct customer segments using clustering algorithms. Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Dimensionality reduction using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.
- Clustering with **K-Means** and analyzing the results.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering and PCA
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## Results
- Identified unique customer segments based on their purchasing behaviors.
- Generated actionable insights for targeted marketing and resource optimization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/Identify_Customer_Segments.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Run the notebook or script for analysis.
